                            <p>On the first day we started at 10am, we had an introduction and got to learn about the types of things that Red Hat do.
                                 I found this very interesting as I didnt know much about them before hand. We learned that they are an open-source software company. 
                                 Throughout the day we took part in many workshops. we had a workshop with Jess where we learned about using an app called inkscape 
                                 o design our own logos for the office games room, first we drew our ideas on paper and then we started to work on them using InkScape. After lunch we had a work
                                 shop with Fiona and Tomas where we learned how to code using GitHub, at first I found it queit difficult but after a while it became a lot easier to understand.
                                  I really enjoyed my first day of work experience at Red Hat as it was great fun and I got to meet new people, make new friends and learn new things.</p>

                            <p>We started working at 9:30am where we were taught some more about vs code, we then started to edit our own blogs which we will be 
                                updating each morning throughout the week. next we had a workshop with Owen where we learned about agile. we used a website called 
                                trello to create our own to do, doing and done lists which will help us keep track of the different activitie we will be doing 
                                throughout the week. I enjoyed learning about this method of working and I think it will be very useful in the future. Next we had 
                                a talk from David about his career journey and how he got to where hs is now. We then had lunch where we got to chat to eachother and
                                 play in the games room. After lunch we had a  Microbit workshop with Dominik which i really enjoyed as I have used microbit before so
                                  it was easy to keep up with Dominik as he was explaining. during this workshop we learned how to create a dice aswell as a daylight 
                                  sensor and many other interesting things.

        </p>We started working at 9:30am and got to work on writing our blogs from Tuesday. We used GitHub and vs code to write them using the skills we learned
             on Monday and Tuesday. After this Dominik and Christian talked to us about their career and what they did in college to get to where they are now. Then
              we had an online call with Kellie. We watched a video where she talked about Human Computer Interaction Design. I found this very interesting and I lea
              rned lots of stuff that I wouldnt have known before. We then had some time to build lego so me and my friends Janet and Aimee started to build a lego t
              echnics car but it was very diifficult so we didnt get much done. this was good fun as it was a nice break from our laptops. After this Rachel talked to 
              us about a day in her life which I found very interesting. Next we had lunch, and after lunch we started into a bridge challenge using lollipo sticks and tape to 
              make a bridge with our team, I think this was great fun and a good team bonding exercise.

        </p>On day 4 we started at 9:30 with a townhall meeting. we went to the boardroom and some of the staff members made announcements about different 
        things going on within Red Hat. I found it really cool to attend this meeting as I got to see what it would be like if I worked there. After the meeting
        we went to the kitchen for a delicious breakfast which was very nice. We then spent a little while completing our blogs from the previous day. next we had
        a workshop using processing with Christian which was really fun as I had used it before. After this workshop Lucia came in to talk to us about RHIVOS which
        means Red Hat In Vehicle Operating System. I found this very interesting and it would probably be one of my favouite talks we have gotten all week.
        After this it was lunch so I sat with my friends janet and aimee. After lunch we had a Python workshop with Christian which was really cool as we got to
        edit a game and fix bugs to make it how we wanted it to be.
